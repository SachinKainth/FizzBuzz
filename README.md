# FizzBuzz

A realistic implmentation of the ubiquitous FizzBuzz problem.  Realistic because it mimics the kind of real life scenarios that are faced by development teams when extending their code.

Throughout this implementation I have attempted to adhere to SOLID principles, the DRY principle, made sure that the code is extensible yet simple and have used TDD throughout.

### Step 1

In this step I have coded the canonical implementation.

### Step 2

In this implementation we add a new requirement: the concept of a lucky number, which if contained within an input number returns a different result from those provided by the canonical specification.

### Step 3

Here we add the ability to display a report giving counts of the various outputs of a run of the program.

## Future enhancements

We could add a functionality to display the results on the screen but I decided it was not the point of the exercise so left it out.
